Analysis of Climate Change Effects on Bird Migration Patterns

This project explores the effects of climate change in bird migration patterns over the past decades, emphasizing shifts in migration timing, routes, and population dynamics. The study aims to identify connections between climate variables and alternations in bird behavior by combining and analyzing long-term datasets from land cover changes, climate records, and bird occurrences. This study attempts to offer practical machine learning algorithms, and geospatial heatmaps.  

In order to predict future migration patterns under different climate scenarios, the project includes temporal and spatial analysis of migration patterns, as well as the display of key findings. These initiatives seek to offer a better understanding of how biodiversity is affected by the environmental changes and also to identify areas that are important for conversion.
